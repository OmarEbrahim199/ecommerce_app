## Full stack eCommerce React 'Next.js' application with Stripe and using Sanity as a backend and flexible content management system for digital projects
A modern full stack eCommerce React 'Next.js' application with Stripe and using Sanity as a backend is a web application that allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout using Stripe for payment processing. The application is built using a modern stack of technologies, including Next.js for the frontend, Sanity as a headless CMS for the backend, and Stripe for payment processing.

Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. It provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic code splitting, which can help improve the performance and user experience of a web application. The application will have a clean and modern design, with a responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile devices. Users will be able to browse products, view product details, add products to their cart, and checkout.

Sanity is a headless CMS that provides a powerful and flexible content management system for digital projects. It allows developers to create and manage structured content using a web-based interface, while providing a flexible API for fetching and manipulating data. The application will use Sanity as a backend to manage product and user data. The application will be able to fetch data from Sanity using its GraphQL API and use it to render content on the frontend.

Stripe is a popular payment processing service that allows businesses to accept payments online. Stripe provides a simple and secure way for users to enter their payment information and complete a transaction. The application will use Stripe to handle the payment processing for each transaction, ensuring that user's payment information is kept secure.

To build the application, you will need to use a combination of frontend and backend technologies, including Next.js, Sanity, Stripe, and GraphQL. You will need to set up a development environment, create a database schema for storing product and user data, and integrate Stripe for payment processing. You will also need to implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

Overall, a modern full stack eCommerce React 'Next.js' application with Stripe and using Sanity as a backend is a complex application that requires a good understanding of frontend and backend development, as well as experience working with payment processing services like Stripe and headless CMS like Sanity. However, with the right tools and expertise, it's possible to create a high-quality eCommerce application that provides users with a seamless and secure online shopping experience.






## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
